This repository stores the files which are related to the cosmic ray project at Georgia State University

In recent years, there are a number of growing applications of using cosmic ray measurements. At Georgia State University, a novel, portable and low-cost cosmic ray detector has been developed. One of the main goals of this project is to install this detector as many places as possible around the world to monitor the space and earth weather. 

In this repository, a rich set of documents for this project will be made available. Please contact Xiaochun He (xhe@gsu.edu) for more information.
